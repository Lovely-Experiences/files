**Please note the following:**
* You are required to have permission from LovelyJacob before hosting any events. 
* LovelyJacob must grant you host permissions in the game's code before you can get started. (You may have already been added, however, it's a good idea to ask first anyways.)
* Do **not** use commands when you are not currently hosting, unless given permmision from the current host of that session. 
* If no session is going on, then no commands are to be used at all, other then for moderation purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started, you must first run the following command: 
```
team me host
```

> To run commands, you must use the command bar. To open the command bar, press the quote key on your keyboard. (`'`)
> <br>*Mobile support is coming soon.*

*(optional)* 

The board message will automatically change to "starting soon...". However, you can set it to a custom message if you would like. 
```
setboardmsg Starting at 3:00PM EST! Invite your friends!
```

---

Once it is time to start, you should force everyone to look at the board by running the following command: 
```
toggleboardpov
```

# Rest of the guide is coming soon!
